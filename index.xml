&lt;p>My opponent played a Smith Morra Gambit but only to retreat the Queen to its initial square 4.
I decided to transition to the Sicilian Dragon that I know well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game was decided by a poor piece placement from my opponent which openened for tactic possibilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Game 2: Abusing the KID bishop</title><link>https://fookh.github.io/ChessBlog/post/game-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fookh.github.io/ChessBlog/post/game-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My opponent choose a very timid strategy by playing a semi-slav for White.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to open up the center and a tactic decided the game by move 11.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Game 1: The London failure</title><link>https://fookh.github.io/ChessBlog/post/game-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fookh.github.io/ChessBlog/post/game-1/</guid><description>Summary My opponent played the London System and I responded with the King&amp;rsquo;s Indian setup. I tried to break in the center to challenge his position but failed to do so properly. By move 13, the game was basically over with a 4.5 avantage for white after a disastrous queen move.
My post-game analysis shows that there was at least two good opportunities that I missed during the game.
