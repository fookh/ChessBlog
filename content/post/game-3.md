## Summary

My opponent played a Smith Morra Gambit but only to retreat the Queen to its initial square 4. 
I decided to transition to the Sicilian Dragon that I know well.

The game was decided by a poor piece placement from my opponent which openened for tactic possibilities.

## Opening and initial setup

I don't know the Smith Morra Gambit opening theory but neither did my opponent.

He chose the least ambitious setup possible:

While the computer prefer a setup closer to the Scheveningen Sicilian, it doesn't seem to offer a clear advantage.

I decided to go for my usual setup and I'm fairly happy with that decision.

Note than by trading his bishop for my knight, I had to b-file opened for my rook rather than the c-file.

## Unnecessary complications

### Trust the setup (or calculate)

I got afraid after my opponent played Re1. 

I figured that my knight would be kicked away unless I was ready to accept a queen trade.
If I hadn't been lazy and actually calculated the line, I would have realized that this would have been fine.

### The Queen belongs on c7

I tried to improve my Queen twice.

The first one was actually terrible. The second one was less of a mistake but didn't achieve anything.
The computer definitely believes that it belongs on c7 where its the most active.

### Pushing the pawns is OK !

In this game, I kept trying to improve my pieces when my setup actually very good.

The center was waiting to be taken and my opponent poor development actually made this easy for me.

Fortunately, he helped me but exchanging the bishops and giving me a chance to kick his knight.

## The winning tactic

{{< figure src="/images/posts/p003/07.PNG" title="The White seems tied up, but how to win?">}}

In this position, I realized there had to be tactics to be found.

White position is crambling. The knight on b2 and the c2 pawn are hanging. The knight on c2 is only protected by the Queen and the rook which can be threatened. And finally, a knight could fork the Queen and the Rook if he managed to reach c2.

I opted for this solution as it felt solid.

I blundered the pawn on b7 but the position was already winning.

## Conclusion

A solid game overall against a very passive opponent.

The post game analysis makes me feel like I took too long to take over the center. 
I'll try to be more pushing once I feel like I have a better setup than my opponent.

- Setup pieces
- Push pawns
- Look for tactics

Let's see how it goes!
