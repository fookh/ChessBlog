## Summary

My opponent choose a very timid strategy by playing a semi-slav for White. 

I decided to open up the center and a tactic decided the game by move 11.

## The game

## Opening up the bishop

After the opening, I realized that I had a better development than my opponent and I wanted to accelerate things to enable my bishop.

I choose the c5 break to weaken the a1-h8 diagonal for my fianchettoed bishop.

I had calcuated up to this point where I figured that the discovery attack on the rock and the bishop would be devastating.

### The winning tactic

Luckily, I was right.

But only because my opponent couldn't see the proper defense. Which I didn't see as well to be fair.

My opponent gives away a piece for free and I just need to convert afterwards.

### The proper defense

The correct defense was indeed to block the a1-h8 diagonal but not on c3. 

Nd4 is protected by a pawn and Black cannot reach the rook anymore. Black still has attacking idea but it's not clear if it's worth it.

## Improving the attack

### Preventing b4

{{< figure src="/images/posts/p002/06.PNG" title="The engine suggests this smart move">}}

Instead of rushing to attack the isolated c-pawn, the engine suggests playing a5 to prevent b4.

After taking a closer look, it appears that b4 is the only way to protect the c5 pawn! And as we could see on the sequence above, an exchange on b4 is clearly on Black's favor.

### Keeping in closed

Another Idea would be to keep the center closed and start an attack on the king side. Instead of Ne4, we can play Ne8 and free the way for our e-pawn. White appears cramped and the attack seems devastating.

## Conclusion

I highly doubt that I will encounter this system again because it looks frankly terrible.
However, there are lessons here that are to be remembered.

First, now that I know my discovery bishop attack better, it's time to improve my calculation and see all the possible defenses. Finding a5 should be in my reach and I shouldn't have been surprised by the possible Nd4.

Also, it's worth remembering that a cramped opponent will have trouble defending his king. In this game, the blocked dark squared bishop and the possibility to kick the Nf3 knight by pushing the e-pawn should have been considered. Seeing the move from the White perspective made me realize how hard it was for White to defend the attack.
