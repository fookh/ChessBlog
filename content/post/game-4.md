## Summary
 
This game was a good pratice for my King's Indian Defense.
My opponent knew the opening well, which is rare, and I couldn't quite remember all the idea.

I lost a knight early on in exchange for nice activity which lead me to a winning endgame.
But don't be fooled by the result, my showing was all but controlled.

## Opening and initial setup

For once, my opponent seemed to knew something different than the London System and I was quite shocked.
I very rarely get to play the main line of the King's Indian Defense, even tho I know the main principle.
Let's see if I played the move in correct order.

Now that the center is closed, Black will try to attack on the King side while White will attack on the Queen side.

## Understanding the setup
### Controlling c5

The placement of the Knight in the KID is always confusing to me.

In the Petrosian Variation, because White pushed the d-pawn, we can't play the usual Nc6. But we have the nice c5 square for our Knight! And this is a big thing because White tries to push c5 to undermine our center. However, Nc5 can get kicked out by a simple b2-b4 move which is why we need to play a4!

### The Setup

This is the setup I achieved. It's bad.

Here's a more realistic setup.

We see that the rook and the bishop are properly placed by not blocked by the knight.
Note also that the light squared bishop is ready to join the attack from a distance.

### The aftermath

Because of my poor strategy, I quickly lost a knight. 

I still got 3 pawns in the process and tried to play with the created activity.

## Winning the game

Under pressure, my opponent quickly gave the piece back but without the 3 pawns.

Few moves later, all the pieces were exchanged and we started this easy final.

## Conclusion

My understanding of the Petrosian Variation was very poor and I quickly got outplayed.

Luckily, I got my way out of this but it's important to remember the basics!

- Prevent b4 with a5
- Control c5 with a knight
- Push f5 AND g5
- Put the rook on the 7th and the bishop on f8
